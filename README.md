## Credits & Acknowledgement

This project is based on [BreezyVoice](https://github.com/mtkresearch/BreezyVoice) by MediaTek Labs,  
a voice-cloning TTS system tailored for Taiwanese Mandarin with phonetic control via 注音 (bopomofo).  
The original project was derived in part from [CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice), and is part of the [Breeze2 model family](https://huggingface.co/collections/MediaTek-Research/breeze2-family-67863158443a06a72dd29900).

We appreciate the efforts of the original authors, and this repository continues that work by providing deployment-ready infrastructure, Windows compatibility, and modular serving enhancements.
